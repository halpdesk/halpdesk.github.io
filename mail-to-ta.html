Hello dear Sirs/Madames,

It is the second time I had to run to the school to pick up my daughter, and it's freezing outside. I think you should compare your time tables to the actual departures for your public transports, and you will find that you can kill two birds with one stone. The first bird are the angry passengers, like me, who lost my _essentials_ on my way to school. Literally; some swedes refer to this temperature as "el-tortyr i pungen-kylan". That's just how cold it is.

The second bird are the chauffers, who has to suffer the many angry shouts from teacher Karens to slow the f--- down. The problem is that they always seem to be in a hurry, and as you've probably have guessed, this is because of your time tables. If you need help I would be willing to offer you to sell my self (and my brain) to help you craft an AI that overcomes the difficult and non-trivial _traveling salesman problem_. Please note that while I am traveling, and trying to sell myself (as well as my brain), I am not a traveling salesman. Nor am I a salesman. The problem applies to me nonetheless; it is a model analog.

Oh, and also, when I am saying to kill the two birds, what I mean is to make it better for them. A better expression would be to care for two birds with one nest (the nest being the bus, for example), but I think you understand what I mean.

Best regards,
Dad</pre>
