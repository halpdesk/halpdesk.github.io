# Semantic Competition

Semantic competition is an aspect of cognitive science that highlights the complexity and adaptability of human thought. According to Douglas Hofstadter, when we encounter a new piece of information, multiple potential meanings or associations are activated in the mind. At the time of recollection of this information, these meanings compete with each other until one interpretation emerges.
