# AI and UBI

```
Dear [Political Party Representative],

I hope this message finds you well. As our society increasingly embraces the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to address the potential challenges associated with these advancements. I am writing to you today to present an argument for the implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a means to balance the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of AI.

AI and LLMs have the potential to revolutionize industries and improve efficiency, but they also pose significant risks to the workforce. As AI displaces jobs, particularly in roles involving repetitive tasks or low-skilled work, unemployment rates may rise, pushing more individuals below the poverty line. This can lead to reduced consumer spending, negatively affecting the overall economy and driving up the cost of goods and services.

Moreover, AI-induced unemployment and wage stagnation can contribute to growing income inequality, exacerbating social issues and environmental degradation. Impoverished populations often lack access to sustainable resources and opportunities, which can further perpetuate these problems.

Universal Basic Income presents a potential solution to these challenges by providing financial security to those affected by AI-related job losses. By guaranteeing a minimum income for all citizens, UBI can help reduce poverty rates and provide a safety net for those facing economic instability. Importantly, UBI also offers individuals the necessary resources and time to reskill, learn new trades, or pursue further education, enabling them to successfully adapt to the changing job market and avoid the spiral of poverty and homelessness.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.

Sincerely,

Daniel Wiltshire Lepp√§nen
