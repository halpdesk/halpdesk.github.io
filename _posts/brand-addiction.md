Copilot code says: Brand addiction is a term used to describe the psychological dependence on a particular brand or product. It is characterized by a strong emotional attachment to the brand, a sense of identity or self-worth tied to the brand, and a desire to consume or engage with the brand regularly. Brand addiction can lead to compulsive buying behavior, financial strain, and negative impacts on mental health and well-being. As brands increasingly use data and technology to personalize marketing messages and create immersive brand experiences, the risk of brand addiction may be heightened, posing challenges for individuals seeking to maintain healthy consumption habits and avoid excessive brand loyalty.
