## Capitalism

Capitalism is often quoted being the best economically implemented model, and is used throughout our western world. In capitalistic societies, decisions and investments are driven by private ownership where prices are regulated by supply and demand. This is called "market economy" and is opposed to "control economy" where the state controls the economy by regulation of goods and prices. The general idea with capitalism is to increase individual success and innovation by competition, and this sometimes speaks to the notion of liberty: equality of everyones right to freedom to do what one chooses. 

### Freedom and equality

To be free means to be able to make choices as you wish without any external factors of your choices. It is impracticable for any type of society to yield maximum freeness (because laws are needed to make sure people does not impair other peoples freeness), so a new term, in societal meaning, is needed. Let's call it freedom.

Consider for a moment that you can choose from a list of five which school your children will go to, and someone else can choose from 800 schools from all across the country. Both you and the other parents have a choice, but yours is vastly limited. We say here that you do not have as much freedom as the other parents.

Freedom is a relative term. It means that you should have as many choices as anyone else. To have as much freedom as anyone else is imperative to equality. Equality means to have as much freedom as others.

Equality does not rise from having the same set of possibilities, but the capability to act on them. If you can choose from 800 schools but almost all of them are impractical (for example if you can't afford to move), you do not posses the same capability as someone who can, and thus you do not have the same freedom. 

### Capitalism and freedom

Capitalism is a producer-centric concept. The idea of equality and freedom is based on the assumption that because everyone has the economic possibilities to do what they wish, they can. 

But the economic possibility is just one narrow factor. Let's say you want to create a business. Maslovs pyramid tells us that to do it in any meaningful way one must meet all needs there is to fullful the pyramid before you get to the top: physical needs, security, social needs, and esteem.

## Challenges for the youth

In today's capitalistic society consumerism...

Brand addiction is a new psychological phenomenon which is a dependence on a particular brand or product. It is characterized by a strong emotional attachment to the brand, a sense of identity or self-worth tied to the brand, and a desire to consume or engage with the brand regularly. Brand addiction can lead to compulsive buying behavior, financial strain, and negative impacts on mental health and well-being. As brands increasingly use data and technology to personalize marketing messages and create immersive brand experiences, the risk of brand addiction may be heightened, posing challenges for individuals seeking to maintain healthy consumption habits and avoid excessive brand loyalty.
