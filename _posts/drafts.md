# Consciousness

What is conciousness? There are several definitions to distinguish it from mere intelligence. In my article, I will attempt at describing conciousness by the concepts of experience, learning about the word, and make intentional choices. First, I will cover what philosophers say about the truth and what it means to experience it through the lens of our senses and then how learning is a product of experiencing things through time. I will discuss how machines learns in the same way and ultimately, I will discuss how intentionality comes from modelling interference with the world within one's mind before acting and compare that to what we do as humans. 

This is a thought-provoking article that perhaps leaves the reader with more questions than answers. Though it is important to recognise that we uncover truths from asking the right questions; and though this might not be it, it will hopefully help synthesies a collection of historical aspects with a modern view of conciousness in the era of artificial intelligence and help conceptually understand possibilities and limitations of what it can be capable of. The question "How close are we to be able to shape consciousness?" aligns well with David Chalemr's "Hard problem of conciousness" and is currently of the highest interest when incorporating AI to our daily lives, as AI is already a living partner to some in our youngest generation.

Further discussions in the open topic of AI will ask fundamental questions in the fields of epistomology and ethics: are we wasting away with the introduction of AI by letting it decide on all humanly important questions and letting us become trusting but passive observers that just feed on instructions of what to do, how and when to do it (all forms of advertsing and propaganda), etc. These questions 

## History of reality and perception

It has been a long standing philosophical inquery on how our mind interprets the world. Plato presented in his Socratic dialogue "The Republic" the idea of "Allegory of the cave" where humans are limited by their own minds to experience the real world. 

He described a group of people chained inside a cave, watching shadows cast on a wall by objects passing in front of a fire behind them. The people are prisoners to the distortions of the phantoms and silhuettes which are mere representations of the world outside. What Plato means by this is that the deeper truths of the world are obscured from our understanding of reality.

In an ontological perspective, Plato was an idealist that believed that the real world consits of a higher realm of perfect and immutable ideas such as beauty, justice, and shapes. Ideas might be possible to construct in the mind but impossible to construct in our limited world — any wordly creation or access of these concepts would be only imperfect distortions. For example, it is possible to think of a perfect circle, but any attempt to create one would have flaws. Imagine drawing a circle on a piece of paper with any tools, old and modern. If you zoom in enough and you will see that it is not perfectly round.

In his Meditations on First Philosophy, published 1641, René Descartes also doubted the reliability of the senses, famously stating _"Cogito, ergo sum"_ (_"I think, therefore I am"_). Just like Plato, he believed that while sensory experiences may deceive us, the ability to reason could still provide certain knowledge. This rationalist view emphasized that the mind can uncover truth through logic despite our sensory limitations, just as with the perfect circle. Plato’s ideas also influenced Immanuel Kant who shared his views in his work Critique of Pure Reason, 1781. He argued that there is a distinction between _noumena_, or _things-in-themselves_ which exist independently of our perception, and _phenomena_, the way we perceive and experience the world, filtered through our senses and mental faculties.

Building on Plato’s dualistic world views, Kant introduced the concepts of knowledge he called _a priori_ and _a posteriori_. A priori knowledge is independent of experience, such as mathematics and logic, while a posteriori knowledge depends on experience, such as empirical observations. This means that the perfect circle is a noumen, a _thing-it-itself_ that can be taught with knowledge alone. The constructed circle is a _phenomena_ that we percieve and experience as a posteriori knowledge.

The idea is further shaped by the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who proposed, in his work Phenomenology of Spirit, 1807, that truth is not static but evolves through a dialectical process. According to Hegel, understanding comes from the clash of opposing ideas (thesis and antithesis) leading to a higher synthesis. This view suggests that human understanding of reality changes over time, emphasizing historical progress and the unfolding of consciousness. Together with his earlier collegues in the field, this implies learning from experience. 

In discord with Platos objective truths, Fredrich Nietzsche, argued that there is no single reality, but rather multiple perspectives shaped by individual experiences, cultural contexts, and power dynamics. His famous claim that _“there are no facts, only interpretations.”_ critiqued the search for objective truth. Edmund Husserl took a second step in this direction with this focusing on how objects are perceived through consciousness. He introduced the concept of intentionality, the idea that consciousness is always about something, and that objects are perceived through our subjective experiences.

The ideas about perception and reality were also developed by 20th-century philosopher Martin Heidegger, who explored the relationship between being and human experience. Heidegger argued that human beings are unique because of their awareness of their own existence, a concept he called Dasei ("being-there"). He also emphasized the idea that human existence is inherently social and interconnected with others, which he called Mitsein ("being-with"). Our understanding of the world, according to Heidegger, is shaped not only by our individual perceptions but also by our interactions with other people and the shared social world we inhabit. For Heidegger, understanding reality involves recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings, as well as our place in that shared world.

## Evolution of brain and behaviour

In 1859, Charles Darwin, a botanist and philosopher, introduced the theory of evolution in his groundbreaking work "On the Origin of Species". Darwin proposed that all living organisms have evolved from common ancestors through the process of natural selection. This theory became the foundation of modern biology and reshaped how we understand life’s diversity on Earth. With the advent of Darwin’s theory, philosophers and scientists began to view the brain and sensory perception as tools shaped by natural selection for survival rather than for uncovering the truth. Evolutionary psychologists argue that our perception is limited to what is necessary for survival and reproduction, not necessarily an accurate reflection of the external world.

A hundred years later, the field of cybernetics emerged that explors how systems — biological, mechanical, and social — regulate themselves and adapt to changing environments. A key figure in this field was Ross Ashby, a British psychiatrist and cyberneticist, who applied systems theory to understanding the brain’s role in regulating behavior. Ashby’s 1956 book, "An Introduction to Cybernetics", proposed that for any system (including the human brain) to function effectively, it must operate as a regulator of its environment.

Ashby’s most influential idea was the Good Regulator Theorem, which states that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." In other words, for the brain to guide an organism’s behavior effectively, it must construct an internal model of the external world. This model doesn’t need to be perfectly accurate; it only needs to be sufficient for survival. The brain creates simplified representations and predictions of the environment, allowing organisms to react in ways that enhance their chances of survival His work tied into earlier evolutionary ideas, reinforcing the notion that the brain’s primary function is to predict and adapt to environmental changes. 

The brain isn’t designed to perceive reality as it is but to model the world in ways that support survival. This idea is advanced in cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman's 2020 book, "The Case Against Reality", who argues that our perceptions are not a window to the world but a simplified interface that helps us navigate our environment. Hoffman introduces the Interface Theory of Perception, which suggests that our brains construct a simplified model of reality that is useful for survival, rather than an accurate representation of the world. According to Hoffman, our perceptions are shaped by evolutionary pressures to help us survive and reproduce, not to uncover the truth about the world.

## Machine learning and AI

The history of philosophers and their ideas illustrate how the question of whether we perceive the world as it truly is has been interpreted in diverse ways throughout history, with each philosopher contributing a new layer to our understanding of perception, reality, and truth. From Plato’s Allegory of the Cave to modern theories of perception and reality, the debate continues about the nature of of the world and the limits of human understanding. The essense of our world and our perception, experiences, learning taking action alludes to the idea of consciousness. 

With rise of AI we might be closer to the answer than ever before. AI works by the method of machine learning, which means to feed facts into a system to let it learn by the attributes and patterns of true and false data so that can separate fact from fiction. By giving it test data, it is possible to score the accuracy of an AI, just as with any student taking a test in their field. There is also a form of machine learning that is unsupervised, where it is tasked with identifying patterns, structures, or relationships in the data on its own. If we accept Nietzsche' view that there are no _a priory_ knowledge but only learning from experiences, this type of learning resembles that of Human learning through expereinces.

## Intentionality


First, let's look at a more modern metaphor on Plato's Allegory of the case. Imagine an audience sitting in a dark theater watching a film projected onto a screen. The light from the projector passes through a film reel, casting moving images that depict a story. While these images reflect elements of reality they are only distorted and simplified representations. Plato argued that, like the audience, the true world is only mediated by our senses and perceptions by this projection.

The idea is the same, but the new metaphor lends itself to a sense of a social and shared experience, as an audience seeing other people on a screen performing very realistic human interactions. It also lets us understand that the distortion can be quite real, just as any recorded image can be. The idea I want to get to is that the picture we see at the cinema is something we've recorded and play back to ourselves to understand the world, and make conclusions decisions.

Modern AI and machine learning are also based on this idea. We feed the machine with data, and it learns to predict and adapt to the environment. The machine doesn't need to understand the world as it is, but to model the world in ways that support its task. The machine creates simplified representations and predictions of the environment, allowing it to react in ways that enhance its chances of success.

Much like with the many philosophers, like Kant's or Heidegger's ideas of what is real and what is interpreted and involved, or Hegels thesis and antithesis, the machine synthesises information and learns from the real world data and adapts to the environment. This idea of a conscious behaviour is appallingly close to what large language models do, and we can feel it through various chat GPTs today.

With the idea that a brain, or any conscious being is be a model of the system it regulates, we can see that the AIs are a model of the world they are trained on. The machine learning agent doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to be sufficient for the task it is evolved for. This echoes a similarity with the avolutionary Darwinian theory. 

If you look closely at todays news or documentaries in the subject you will see the AI science community has already worked out how to connect an internal model as the feedback loop to how it should behave, putting together thesis and antithesis to form a synthesis of its own beaviour.

The picture above depicts a machine trying to put an object onto a piece of paper. In the left picture, we can see what the machine is actully seeing, and in the right picture, we see the internal model trying to figure out beforehand how it should move according to its specified task. The machine has come up with the right picture itself, from the very functionality achieved by a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model.

The AI is following Ross Ashby's Good Regulator Theorem, that interally models the system it is regulating. The task of the machine is to move accoring to what the generative model has predicted it to do. Together, no piece of this machinery can be said to be counscious, but together it can be said that it sees, internalises a will to act and then act upon that will. It can also learn from its mistakes and adapt to the environment.

Along with this behaviour, with the possibility to store data to have memories, one must ask the question: how is a machine of this level (at least from a philosophical standpoint) different from what we do as humans? We see, we internalise, we act, we learn, and we adapt. We have memories, we have a will to act, and we have a model of the world we act upon. We are not perfect, but we are sufficient for the task we are evolved for.

What does it mean for our deeper truths of the world? What becomes of of our social connectedness, and of spirituality, of religion, if we find a way for machines to become conscious?
