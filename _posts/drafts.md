# Do we see the world as it is?

It has been a long standing philosophical inquery on how our mind interprets the world. Plato presented in his Socratic dialogue "The Republic" the idea of "Allegory of the cave" where humans are limited by their own minds to experience the real world. He describes that the world is presented to us in a distorted way by being prisoners in a cave that sits behind a camp fire and look at the back wall. The real world and its objects flashes by in front of the fire, but the prisoners can only see the shadows.

An easier description of this interpretation can be done with a metaphor by the modern cinema. The audience sits in a dark room and watches a screen that is cast to them from a projector above. The projector is given the light from the film reel which are the series of images that are projected to the screen. The actual film depicts the real world, but the screen shows a somewhat distorted picture.

## The history of interpretation

In an ontological perspective, Plato was an idealist believed that the real world consits of a higher realm of perfect ideas and immutable, describing beauty, justice, or shapes. Humans could then only access these concepts through their senses but they would be imperfect. An example is the shape of a circle: in our imperfect reality, there can only exist an approximation of a circle; because if we zoom in enough, we will see that the circle is not perfect. The concept of a perfect circle only lives in the ideal world.
