# Smart fooding

```poem
to eat my ala carte
I have to be smart
go to the bathroom for a brown depart
then back to the table and restart

oh, my food cart
faster than a go-kart
at the end of my bottom part
errupts in an explosive farrt

my toilet from walmart
now painted with my shart
from the bottom of my heart
I call it cermaic art
```
