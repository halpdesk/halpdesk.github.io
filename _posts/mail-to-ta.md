# Mail to the transport authority

```poem
Hello dear Sirs/Madames,

It is the second time I had to run to the school to pick up my daughter, and it's freezing outside. I think you should compare your time tables to the actual departures for your public transports, and you will find that you are lacking in the arriving-in-time department. And you will find that you can kill two birds with one stone. 

The first one is people who complains a lot (though I am just reaching out with a solution), even though I lost my essentials on my way to school - yes, it's that cold - literally).

Then we have the chauffers, who has to suffer the many angry shouts from teacher Karens to slow the f--- down. You see, the chauffers are always in a hurry, and they really do need to slow down. A child-plowing-type disaster is waiting to around the next corner, and this is the second bird.

I would be willing to sell my self (and my brain) to help you all create for you a program to, finally, overcome the so-called difficult travelling salesman problem. Please note that while I am travelling, and trying to sell myself (as well as my brain), I am not a travelling salesman. Nor am I a salesman. I am a programmer, and the problem is an analog. Well, it's a generalisation of "vehicle routing problem" which is a non-trivial problem in NP-hard space, to be exact (I have a keen eye for details).

I am also a problem solver, and I look for solutions outside the box. Who care's if it's an NP-hard problem? I will work around it (no unnecessary short-cuts though). Let's create millions of permutations and simulate the shinkansen out of Gothenburg - it's not that big. But hey, I am also a team player, so let's hear your suggestions.

When people arrive on time, everything is good. When people arrive late, everything is bad. It is actually so much so gooder that Maslow would need to re-create his triangle; not only do we need food, water, and shelter, but we also need to be "in location A on time Z" for it (the feeding, drinking, sleeping, etc.) to happen. You can see that I also understand the customers', the good people in our fair city. Right?

Anyway, I am looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Dad

P.S. I forgot to say that the stone in the (first) analogy is that you should hire me

P.P.S. Contact information: +4671360693, Daniel Lepp√§nen, programmer

P.P.P.S. I also have personal interest in this, and it is for my daughter to arrive on time. The next generation is important because who else will take over the very advanced and supoer-complex problems of the future of transport? I'm here for the long run.

P.P.P.P.S. Thinking about it now, it was a poor analogy, the bus plowing the children likened to a bird that gets killed with a stone. I have no problem admitting when I am wrong. 

P.P.P.P.P.S. I really do mean to save the children. I am a father after all. Let's reframe it to "a nest to save two birds". We can have the martketting department work on that when I start.
