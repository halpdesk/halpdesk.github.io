# Humans (work in progress)

I woke up in my sleeping station after my 7 hour hibernation, or _sleep_. I moved the shading controls, or _blinds_ (because the blind the light) to let in a bit of day light. _Day_ is a phenomenon that happens in cycles because our planet rotates around its own axis and regurarly points to our hosting star. It is comprised about 24 hours (and an hour is equal to 3,600 times the length of time it takes for the electromagnetic radiation from a Cesium-133 atom to oscillate 9,192,631,770 times). Day is different for other humans, because they are spread across _the earth_ (our planet) and revolves around _the sun_ (our hosting star).
        
As I walk from my sleeping station into the hallway that connects several stations in my home (home is where I live - where I hibernate and digest nutrition), I see a paper (which is a thin, flexible material primarily made from plant fibers on which one can print symbols on) on the ground by the terminal of my home. Some papers are still stuck in the input control of the terminal gate, also called _a letter box_.

Humans used to communicate their personal matters with these papers, called _letters_, with one another, but today (which is approximately two billion hours since humans evolved from its primate ancestor - though we have not kept records for more than 20 million hours) most of the letters include _commercial_ which is writing and drawings for upgrades on stations. 

I pick up the letter from the floor: it's a message urging me to join a group of other humans to play make-believe on an ultimate creator, who supposedly created the universe (these concepts go by the name of _religions_). Though I am not interested in this kind of play. I do not identify with any one specific religion.

I walk to my nutrition station, and open the temperature-regulated container for humanly accepted edibles, or food, also called _refrigerator_: my body craves nutrition. I am _hungry_. The internal lamp lights up my food , and I extract some "butter" and "cheese", and then some "bread" from the dry-food container. With these ingredients, I prepare a "sandwich" and start my daily morning routine of inserting the food into my _mouth_, the personal bodily input, which is also my output for communication for humans.

(The food will get processed in my body and eventually reach the output for my body, which will then be disposed in the waste disposal station, on a sitting-on object made of cheramic, called a _toilet_. The waste disposal station also have a corner that outputs water in arrays from a nozzle in which I can place my body beneath to clear the dirt from the exterior of my body (called taking a _shower_). So, the waste disposal station it is a combined interior-exterior-type disposal waste station, though only for my body and the body of other humans - let's call them _people_ - not for things).

After processing the food, I sit down in my living room. The living room is a station where things happens in humans every-day cycle, mostly by communicating with other humans to get the newest information, or _news_, about their every-day life cycles, but also gathering news from around the earth. The latter happens by a _radio_ (which interpret longer electromagnetic waves and procude sound) or by a light-_and_-sound emitting apparatus, also called a _TV_ (derived from the _Greek_ word television, which means to get vision from a distance). I start the TV to get the latest news. It's mostly about other people, but commercials are commonly shown or transmitted through these devices.

On the TV I see two people on a platform who are _debating politics_. The platform is a special-built debate-station for politics. Politics is a people-way of describing how to govern things of other people and their stations, by setting rules to allow and disallow human action, stations upgrades and how to use things. Debating is about communicating politics. Though they are not debating which rules to set, but which they think are good, so that other people who thinks similarly can say who is the best among the people to set the rules, or _govern_ (and we have a vertical- and horisontal multi-government setup here on earth, so there is a lot to govern).

Currently, they are debating how much to _pay_* for the _fuel_ for portable transport stations, or _automobiles_, that people use to get from one station to another. People are in dire need to be at different stations during the light of day (and during the dark of day, or _night_, it is expected that all people stay in their sleeping stations, though it is not a rule).

(* Pay means for the subject, the _payer_, to exchange things for other things with another human, the _payee_; and the things given by the payer are points (also known as _money_) that measure _economic wealth_, and economic wealth is the amount of money you have to pay for things. The explanation is kind of circular but people made sense of it.)

I turn the TV off (meaning to stop supplying it with _electricity_ - I will get back on this topic) because I am scheduled to do some _work_. Work is a sort of labour that means to provide services (meaning you do something for another human) or create _goods_ (stations or upgrades to them, or nutrition-based items) that other people are willing to pay for. People have this facsination with money because everyone has bought into the idea that everyone wants more of it: if you have it you can pay for anything you want, and the people on the recieving end can do the same.

I go to my work station. The station includes the devices I need to do work. I am a writer, which means that I write letters that are interesting for other people to see - at least, it should be if I do my work well. I then send these letters to a station (for example a _news agency_) that makes copies of them and distribute them to more people (another kind of work is to distribute these letters to more people). The people that receives these letters reads them in their every day-light cycles (usually during day, but perhaps during night as well, if they are not sleeping).

I am currently working on a series that describes human _society_; how and why humans do things in the way they do. It is kind of fascinating when I think about it. For example I debate why we elect people to govern other people on the basis of their power to debate things, rather than on their merit to follow through governing other people.

About electricity: humans taught themselves to use electricity to do some labour for them about two million hours ago. Most stations today includes things that are powered by electricity. For example the radio, the TV or the refrigerator. The electricity is generated by stations that is built to convert the energy of moving things (such as air and water flows) through electromagnetic force - the movement is connected to strong blocks that exert magnetic waves by rotating them inside a copper coil to create electrical current, or by burning material in a process called combustion. The electricity is then distributed to other homes and their stations through a network of wires made from long, thin and flexible material primarily made from metal fibers that can conduct electricity. 

Society on earth is grossly divided into two groups of people. There are _the rich_ who are wealthy and can pay for stations and devices that does manual labour for them. And there are _the poor_ who has to do all manual labour themselves. These people does not have a waste disposal station, let alone any delivery of water. They have to fetch their water from natural water sources themselves. Then then there are of course many in-betweens. The range of wealth among people is derived from human history; there are groups and people that have done well and those who have not. 

---

Most homes have electricity today, at least where people are wealthy (though by the time of writing, people who are poor do not have electrical power-driven stations, and they are said to live in developing areas, meaning they will get it later). The template home of those goverened in wealthy areas (living in industrial areas) includes sleeping stations, food stations, living stations and waste disposal stations. My home is not far from the template. I changed some colors here and there, for example on the shade controllers (which I forgot to mention are called curtains) and other things made from that type of material (which is textile; a kind of paper, but a more flexible material that is by design a bad heat-conductor so it keeps temperature). Not everything is cusomisable though. For example, the the apparature in the food and the disposal stations are mostly white. The food station is white because it is easier to see if it is clean, and the disposal station is white because it is easier to see if it is dirty. The living station is mostly black, because it is easier to see the light-and-sound emitting apparatus in the dark of day.

The color white means what we observe with our human part that registers photons when most light bounces of an objects surface, and black means that most light is absorbed by its surface (meaning we observe it as nothing). When only light of about 700 nano-meters of wave-length is emitted, we call it red, and blue is about 450 nano-meters. Humans also use the colors to mean other things, for example in politics. Red politics is for people who wants to change things, and blue politics is for people who wants to keep things as they are. There is also green politics, which refers to the color of our plants (an organism that at about 525 nano-meters wavelengths, and means to preserve the plants because they are important for humans to be able to live on Earth: these organisms digest carbon and produce oxygen, and humans digest oxygen and produce carbon).

-- Not sure if I should delve into human politics at this point - it is a work in progress --

I think about the color of green for some time, and write some symbols that explain the politics around it. A peculiar thought catches my brain (the human part that makes high- and low level decisions, if that is how it really works: we don't know if thoughts are created by choice or if it is already determined - and choice is a human concept for being able to freely select things we think, entirely, completely disregarding the order of physical inter-actions). 

As I write about the green politics I find a dilemma on my beliefs and ideal (the thoughts and ideas that form me and my thinking, and for your information I believe we have a choice on the matter - i.e. that matter is not deterministically interacting with one another). I feel satisfation about having stations and things that are produced in wealthy areas of the earth which disregards the plants that give humans the ability to live (becuase burning these powers the combustion stations that give electricity to work on ~peripherals(devices)~  and things for humans) but at the same time I can process the information that it is not sustainable: if all humans strive for better homes, its stations and things instead of caring for the plants that is a condition for humans, all humans would stop living.



A peculiar discovery
This is not part of the story above. I just need to share a discovery I made writing this story.
        
The story is written as a message to a non-human entity (i.e. an alien species) that has no recollection of our human culture. During the writing, I was constantly fed suggestions by my in-editor GPT (Microsoft Copilot) that at first did not understand anything because the words, their order and context is not something (probably) that any GPT has been trained on. But as I continued writing, the suggestions started to make sense. They started to suggest things that were in line with the story I was writing. It was as if the GPT was learning about our human culture as I was writing about it. 

In this sense, I feel like the GPT itself is this non-human entity that I am writing to. It is learning about our culture as I am writing about it, as though it was sentient. At the time of writing, it is a very eerie and peculiar feeling. 

Here are some early screenshots when the GPT did not understand a thing I was writing about:
