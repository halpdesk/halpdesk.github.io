# Access control models

Access control is a fundamental security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use resources  to ensure that the right people have access to the right resources in a computing environment. It is a critical function for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems.

There are many models of access control such as DAC, RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC, etc., that can be implemented to protect data and resources, but they all build upon two primary concepts: permission to perform actions, and access to things.

## A linguistic interpretation

In FOL, predicate logic we  1. define a set of objects, 2. define a set of predicates, 3. define a set of functions, and 4. define a set of constants.
