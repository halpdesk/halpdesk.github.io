# The Clock Merchant (work in progress)

This is a work in progress - I am currently working on a story about a clock merchant in the finnish Karelia during the 1950s-60s. 
The idea comes from my father, who at his childhood had a clock merchant visit the during christmas. I want the story to be authentic and also using ideas from the writing of Daniel Tammet.

I will write this story by my own capabilities, by analysing words and word nets, their melodies and meanings.

Currently, I have a couple of concepts in mind, the first is a discovery by myself and the others from my memory of reading Tammet: 

1. Use describing words of other concepts semantically close to the thing that is described. As an example, a country-side can be described by the people living there and a good description then becomes "law-abiding country-side"
2. Repeating of consonants (or syllables if possible) can create anticipatory comfort

I made an initial word net, that looks like this:  List of examples sentences:
* Oil-dripping machinery
* The pompous patriarch
* He sold old ornate time-keeping clock-works
* Pure pieces of ever-ticking restless crafts
* He dipped his bread in the dodgy stew and took a sip from his dreadful can o' brew
* The music of machinery was meditaitve to the merchants ear
* The clunking car kept him company
* He was not alone; his comapny composed of the clicking clock-work
* while his old oil-stained cramped car co-joined in clunked calamitous counts
* The place was plain; as was the pomoous patriarch; strait to the point: "we'll prepare dinner", he promised, "park your car by the post past the premise"
