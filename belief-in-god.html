    <h1>Belief in God</h1>
    <p>If I believe in God, it's the God presented by the Church of Sweden, as shown to me here in Gothenburg. This belief has been shaped through conversations with the priests before Elsa's baptism and my wedding, and when we've visited the Cathedral and talked to the priest before Hannah's baptism, or during Science Week when we listened to theories about creation.

    If one believes that there is a spiritual higher power, why the ones of one's cultural heritage? Everyone believes in the god or gods of the religion they were raised with. 
    
    I think I have found an answer to that question: if God is indeed omnipotent and omniscient, God must know more than I do, and more than those around me and the science we believe to be true. For example, it is proven that we become better people — emotionally, intellectually, and biologically (in terms of evolution) — when we mix. A society open to people of mixed ethnicity becomes more functional, just as a company succeeds better with people from diverse backgrounds.
    
    Research has repeatedly shown that inclusivity promotes development in all sorts of ways, and I have anecdotal evidence of this in my own workplace as well (if it matters). Therefore, this God, as presented to me, is a truer God than those in religions that lack this inclusivity.
    
    Of course, anyone can use the same argument about their religions, but I am as confident that my argument holds as I am sure that democracy and our Western values are better than societal forms without democratic values such as the equal worth of all people and the right to receive the support they need.
    
    With that said, I don't necessarily believe in exactly the same truth about God as the Church of Sweden, since it varies from parish to parish, but in the truth about God that has emerged in the meetings with the priests I have met and talked to so far.
