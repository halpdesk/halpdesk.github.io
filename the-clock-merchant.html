    <h1>The Clock Merchant (work in progress)</h1>
    <p><em>This is a work in progress</em> - I am currently working on a story about a clock merchant in the finnish Karelia during the 1950s-60s. 
The idea comes from my father, who at his childhood had a clock merchant visit the during christmas. I want the story to be authentic and also using ideas from the writing of Daniel Tammet.

I will write this story by my own capabilities, by analysing words and word nets, their melodies and meanings.

Currently, I have a couple of concepts in mind, the first is a discovery by myself and the others from my memory of reading Tammet: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use describing words of other concepts semantically close to the thing that is described. As an example, a country-side can be described by the people living there and a good description then becomes "law-abiding country-side"</li>
    <li>Repeating of consonants (or syllables if possible) can create anticipatory comfort</li>
</ol>

I made an initial word net, that looks like this:

List of examples sentences:
<ul>
    <li>Oil-dripping machinery</li>
    <li>The pompous patriarch</li>
    <li>He sold old ornate time-keeping clock-works</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pure pieces of ever-ticking restless crafts</li>
    </ul>
    <li>He dipped his bread in the dodgy stew and took a sip from his dreadful can o' brew</li>
    <li>The music of machinery was meditaitve to the merchants ear</li>
    <li>The clunking car kept him company</li>
    <li>He was not alone; his comapny composed of the clicking clock-work</li>
    <ul>
        <li>while his old oil-stained cramped car co-joined in clunked calamitous counts</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The place was plain; as was the pomoous patriarch; strait to the point: "we'll prepare dinner", he promised, "park your car by the post past the premise"</li>
</ul>
