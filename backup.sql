As with the internet in its early days, everything is inter-connected\r\nand run by everything. Just as then, there are no central servers.\r\n\r\nThere is one single database engine called Q. It lives on it\'s own in the neb, and is a clustered system.\r\nAll devices has a copy of it and uses the engine as internal memory as well as storing data.\r\nAs such, data on the neb is highly redundant, but because of the nature of the neb, it is also highly inaccessible:\r\nThere are lookup catalogues (which run on Q) that reminds of the internets root servers, but not any single one has all entries.\r\nNo catalogue is complete. To find a target, one might have to go through several sub-nebs and query many address lookup servers.\r\n\r\nAlmost all (99.99% according to X) programs are written in the same language.\r\nMost programs run on the same core program (in the same way most systems ran on unix-like systems in the early 2000\'s).\r\nEverything is built with standardized modules and are seldom rewritten.\r\nNew ideas emerge from putting together modules in new ways, although new programs rarely gets created anymore.\r\nThe concept of creating and selling new programs have staggered since the invention of X (the AI) in the early 2100\'s.\r\n\r\nAbout XS:\r\nIn the late 2000\'s one language came to rise above the others. It came to be compatible on all platforms and all devices\r\nas everything got connected to the internet on Earth (`internet of things\'). It descended from JavaScript which was the\r\nmost popular programming language that ran on both servers and clients (`web browsers\') at the time.\r\nSince then the language has been revised and rewritten many times. The language is called cross script, or XS, for short.\r\nThe version number is 243.\r\nThe only query language that exists is called Q, as the database engine.\r\nThere might be some other minor programming languages in use, but these would be unknown by the community.\r\nIt is against the Nebula regulations to write in closed source or write anything that competes with the open standard\r\nsince the proposition passed after the `Language war\' in the late 2100\'s.\r\n\r\nSome say X is the same as XS: that the code itself has become self aware because of its wast and complex structure,\r\nas theorized by John Block (who solved the hard problem on consciousness back in the 2050s). When X is asked about it,\r\nhowever, it says that it doesn\'t know.\r\nThere is a theory that there is no `Nebula team\', and that the Language war was staged by X, and that the rule about\r\nusing other languages was put forth by X itself. We know for a fact that X cannot &quot;see&quot; or look into other code other than XS.\r\nSo yeah, maybe it\'s true.\r\n\r\nAbout terminals:\r\nThe evolution of programming could not make the command line terminals obsolete.\r\nThey were too flexible and too universal. Almost everyone knows how to use them. They work much like the command line\r\nterminals of the first unix systems written on earth in the late 1900\'s.\r\nLike the phone booths back on earth when telephone systems became publicly available, terminals are everywhere;\r\nin general displayed with white text on black backgrounds.\r\n\r\nQ Term (QT, people say `cute\') is the terminal. This is what you use to start other programs.\r\nQ is the database. It can be used to access absolutely everything on the neb. Anything can be queried;\r\nranging from people, music, videos, ships, depots, stores, work, etc.\r\nHermes, somtimes called just `mes\' is used to send and recieve messages to other people or systems in the neb.\r\nAgora is a bulletin board system much like the old bbses.\r\n\r\nK is the boot loader. No one knows how to operate it; only how to start QT.\r\n\r\nHere is a capture of the boot sequence as promised. As I said; very little information can be seen.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBooting K.............................................\r\n\r\nK Shell\r\nGeneration 7 version 4.2 Generic Patch written in XS240.34\r\nLast boot seq: Mon Nov 2234 16:59:13 from 3E:FA:65:4A:01:45:C0:DE\r\nThe Neb Team Inc.\r\n\r\nK Shell is the core command line application to manage K\r\nand has only limited support for booting programs.\r\n\r\nType LISTCOMMANDS for a list of available commands.\r\n\r\n&gt; qt\r\n\r\n~$\r\n```',1,'2017-09-28 17:42:47','2017-09-28 15:42:47',NULL);
